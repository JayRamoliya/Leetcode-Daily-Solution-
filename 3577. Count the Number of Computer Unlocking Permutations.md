## 📘 Problem Statement

You are given an array `complexity` of length `n`.

There are `n` locked computers in a room with labels from `0` to `n - 1`, each with its own unique password.

- The password of the computer `i` has a complexity `complexity[i]`.
- The password for the computer labeled `0` is already decrypted and serves as the **root**.
- All other computers must be unlocked using it or another previously unlocked computer.

### 🔓 Unlocking Rule:

You can decrypt the password for computer `i` using the password for computer `j` if:

- `j < i`
- `complexity[j] < complexity[i]`
- Computer `j` must already be unlocked

---

## 🎯 Goal

Find the **number of valid permutations** of `[0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1]` that represent a valid order in which the computers can be unlocked.

Return the result modulo **10⁹ + 7**.

> ⚠️ Note: Computer `0` is already unlocked. It does **not** need to appear first in the permutation.

## ✅ Example 1

**Input:**
```text
complexity = [1, 2, 3]
````

**Output:**

```text
2
```

**Valid Orders:**

```text
[0, 1, 2]
[0, 2, 1]
```

---

## ❌ Example 2

**Input:**

```text
complexity = [3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]
```

**Output:**

```text
0
```

**Reason:**
No smaller-complexity computer exists to unlock the initial ones.

---

## 🧠 Key Observations

* Every computer `i > 0` must have **at least one valid parent**:

  * `j < i`
  * `complexity[j] < complexity[i]`
* If any computer fails this rule → **Answer = 0**
* Once dependencies are valid, the problem becomes:

  > **Counting valid topological orders of a dependency graph**

---

## 🧮 Approach

We simulate the unlocking process step-by-step:

1. Start with `computer 0` unlocked.
2. For each computer `i`:

   * Count how many unlocked computers can unlock it.
   * Multiply this count into the result.
3. If at any step there are **0 possible parents**, return `0`.

## ✅ Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int countPermutations(int[] complexity) {
        final int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;
        long ans = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < complexity.length; ++i) {
            if (complexity[i] <= complexity[0]) {
                return 0;
            }
            ans = ans * i % mod;
        }
        return (int) ans;
    }
}
```

## 🧪 Dry Run (Example 1)

| Step | Computer | Valid Parents | Ways |
| ---- | -------- | ------------- | ---- |
| 0    | 0        | root          | 1    |
| 1    | 1        | 1             | 1    |
| 2    | 2        | 2             | 2 ✅  |

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n²)`
* **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`
* Can be optimized to `O(n log n)` using Fenwick Tree if required.
